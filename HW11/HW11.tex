\begin{problem}{41}
LEt $E$ be the nonmeasurable set desribed in section 18 of the notes. Prove that if $N \subseteq E$ and $N$ is measurable, then $m(N) = 0$. (Hint: imitate the second part of the proof of Theorem 18.1.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{42}
Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a measurable set with $m(A) > 0$. Prove that there exists a subset $B \subseteq A$ such that $B$ is not measurable. (Hint: if $E$ is the nonmeasurable set described in section 18 of the notes, then $A \subseteq \sqcup_{q \in \mathbb{Q}}(q+E)$.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{43}
Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a collection of Borel sets that generates $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$ (i.e. such that $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{E}) = \mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$). Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. Prove that $f$ is measurable if and only if $f^{-1}(E)$ is measurable for all $E \in \mathcal{E}$. (Hint: show that $\{A \subseteq \mathbb{R} : f^{-1}(A)\text{ is measurable}\}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{44}
Let $f_1,f_2,\dots : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be measurable function, let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, and suppose that $f_n \to f$ almost everywhere. Prove that $f$ is measurable.
\end{problem}
