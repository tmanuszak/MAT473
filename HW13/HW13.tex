\begin{problem}{49}
Prove Theorem 22.5 parts (iii) and (iv): Let $f,g : \mathbb{R} \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ be integrable functions.
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(iii)] Suppose that $f \leq g$. Prove that $\int f \leq \int g$.
  \item[(iv)] Prove that $\left| \int f \right| \leq \int | f |$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{50}
Compute the value of the limit $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\infty}\left( 1 + \frac{x}{n} \right)^{-n}\cos \frac{x}{n}dx.$$ Justify every step of your argument. (Hint: use the monotone convergence theorem, and the theorem on equality of the Reimann and Lebesgue integrals when both apply, to show that $e^{-x}$ is integrable on $[0,\infty]$. Then use the dominated convergence theorem.)
