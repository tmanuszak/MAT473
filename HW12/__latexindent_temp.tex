\begin{problem}{45}
  Recall that a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is \textit{measurable} (or \textit{Lebesgue measurable} if for every Borel set $E$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, we have that $f^{-1}(E)$ is a (Lebesgue) measurable set (in $\mathbb{R}$).) We say that $f$ is \textit{Borel measurable} if for every Borel set $E \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, $f^{-1}(E)$ is a Borel set.

  Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $g : \mathbb{R} \to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$. Prove the following. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] If $f$ and $g$ are both Borel measurable, then $g \circ f$ is Borel measurable.
    \item[(b)] If $f$ is measurable and $g$ is Borel measurable, then $g \circ f$ is measurable.
  \end{itemize}
  (It is a fact that there exists examples of measurable functions $f$ and $g$ such that $g \circ f$ is not measurable.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{46}
  Let $f$ be a nonnegative simple function. Define a function $\mu : \mathcal{L} \to [0,\infty]$ by $\mu(E) = \int(f \cdot \chi_E)$. Prove that $\mu$ is \textit{countably additive}: if $E_1, E_2, \dots$ are pairwise disjoint measurable sets, then $\mu(\cup_{i = 1}^{\infty}E_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}m(E_i)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{47}
  Let $f$ be a nonnegative simple function. Prove that the following conditions are equivalent:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] $\int f = 0$
    \item[(b)] $f = 0$ a.e.
    \item[(c)] Let $f = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}a_i\chi A_i$ be any representation of $f$ with $a_i \geq 0$ for all $i$. For each $i$, if $a_i > 0$, then $m(A_i) = 0$.  
  \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{48}
  For $f,g : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ the \textit{join} of $f$ and $g$ is the function $f \vee g : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $$(f \vee g)(x) = \max\{f(x),g(x)\}$$ (i.e. the pointwise maximum of the two functions). The \textit{meet} is defined by $$(f \wedge g)(x) = \min\{f(x),g(x)\}.$$ The \textit{positive and negative parts} of $f$ are defined by $$f_+ = f \vee 0, \hspace{1em} f_- = -(f \wedge 0).$$ Prove the following.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(i)] If $f$ and $g$ are measurable then so are $f \vee g$ and $f \wedge g$.
    \item[(ii)] $f_+ \geq 0,$ $f_- \geq 0$, and $f_+f_- = 0$.
    \item[(iii)] $f = f_+-f_-$ and $|f| = f_++f_-$.
    \item[(iv)] If $g,h \geq 0$ and $f = g - h$, then $g \geq f_+$ and $h \geq f_-$. Also, $g = f_+$ if and only if $h = f_-$, and this happens if and only if $gh = 0$.   
  \end{itemize}
\end{problem}
