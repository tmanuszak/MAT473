\begin{problem}{1}
Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be an open set, let $f : U \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuously differentiable, and let $p = (x_0, y_0, z_0) \in U$ and $c = f(p)$. We let $(x,y,z)$ denote the coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Using the implicit function theorem, and the equation $f(x,y,z) = c$, we can give a precise meaning to the classical expression $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] What is this meaning? Explain carefully.
  
  \hspace{1em} In physical terms, we would be able to find a directional derivative, or quantify a change in direction $y$ for a certain change in direction $x$. Given an example of a surface where this is not always possible, if you consider a function which goes through the cartesian point $(1,0,0) \in S$ with $S$ being a unit sphere. Then, there does not exist a function that can represent $y$ in terms of $x$ and $z$ on the function $f$, since $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$ would be undefined for any function going through that point on the surface of the unit sphere. 

  \item[(b)] What condition guarantees that $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$ makes sense?
  
  \hspace{1em} Since we can supposedly find $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$, then we must've found a function, which approximates $y$ defined as $y : B_s(x_0,z_0) \to B_r(y_0)$, which approximates the level set $\{(x,y,z) \in U : f(x,y,z) = c\}$ such that $f(x,y(x,z),z) = c$ for some $s,r > 0$. This function $y$ is continuously differentiable and if $f(x,y(x,z),z) = c$ is differentiated with respect to $x$, will yield $$f_x + f_y \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} + f_z \cdot 0 = 0.$$ We can then solve $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = -\frac{f_x}{f_y}$. So, since $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$ exists, $f_y$ must be invertible, or not equal to zero. Also, since the function $y$ represented in terms of $x$ and $z$ exist, we must have used implicit function theorem, which relies on $p \in U$ open with $f$ being continuously differentiable and $f(p) = c$.
  
  \item[(c)] Prove the "paradox of classical notation": $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial z} = -1$. State the result as a precise theorem (in non-classical notation), and be sure to give the necessary hypothesis.  
  
  \begin{theorem}{1}
    Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be an open set, let $f : U \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuously differentiable, and let $p = (x_0, y_0, z_0) \in U$ and $c = f(p)$. Suppose there is a continuously differentiable function $y : B_s(x_0,z_0) \to B_r(y_0)$ such that $f(x,y(x,z),z) = c$ and $f_y \neq 0$. Suppose there is a continuously differentiable function $z : B_u(x_0,y_0) \to B_t(z_0)$ such that $f(x,y,z(x,y)) = c$ and $f_z \neq 0$. Suppose there is a continuously differentiable function $x : B_w(y_0,z_0) \to B_v(x_0)$ such that $f(x(y,z),y,z) = c$ and $f_x \neq 0$. Then $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial z} = -1$.
  \end{theorem}

  \begin{sol}
    By applying the implicit function theorem in three different instances, we can show that $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = -\frac{f_x}{f_y}$, $\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -\frac{f_y}{f_z}$, and $\frac{\partial x}{\partial z} = -\frac{f_z}{f_x}$. Thus, \begin{align*}
      \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial z} &= \left( -\frac{f_x}{f_y} \right) \left( -\frac{f_y}{f_z} \right) \left( -\frac{f_z}{f_x} \right) \\ &= -1.
    \end{align*}
  \end{sol}

  \hspace{1 em} The real problem that I see with the classical notation is that $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$ appears to be a fraction (which it is!) but it is hard to see domain restrictions as $\partial x$ alone does not represent anything, hence why it looks like everything should "paradoxically" cancel to be 1, but doesn't.
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{2}
Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be an open connected set and let $f : U \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuously differentiable. Suppose that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0$ throughout $U$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] Suppose that $U$ has the following property: for every vertical line $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, the intersection $U \cap L$ is a subinterval of $L$. Prove that for all $x, y_1, y_2$ such that $(x,y_1)\in U$ and $(x,y_2) \in U$, we have $f(x,y_1) = f(x,y_2)$ (we say that $f$ is \textit{independent of y}).
  
  \begin{sol}
    Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be an open connected set and let $f : U \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuously differentiable. Suppose that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0$ throughout $U$. Let $L = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x \text{ is fixed}\} \subseteq U$. Then, since $f$ is differentiable and $L$ is convex, by the mean value theorem, for $\overline{ab} \subseteq L$, there exists $c \in \overline{ab}$ such that $f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b-a)$. But, $f'(c) = 0$ by hypothesis. Thus, $f(a) = f(b)$, which implies for $(x,y_1),(x,y_2) \in U$, $f(x,y_1) = f(x,y_2)$.
  \end{sol}

  \item[(b)] Let $U = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus ((-\infty,0] \times \{0\})$. (Thus $U$ equals the plane with the nonpositive x-axis removed.) Find a counterexample to the result in part (a)  for $U$, and prove that your counterexample does the job. (In other words find a continuously differentiable function $f : U \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0$ throughout $U$, but such that there exist $x,y_1,y_2$ such that $(x,y_1),(x,y_2) \in U$ and $f(x,y_1) \neq f(x,y_2)$ - and prove that your function $f$ does have all of these properties.)
  
  \begin{sol}
    Let $U = \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus ((-\infty,0] \times \{0\})$ and $f : U \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $$f(x,y) = \begin{cases} 
      x^2 & \text{if } x,y < 0 \\
      0 & \text{else}
   \end{cases}$$
   Then, we have that $f_y = 0$ throughout $U$, and $f_x = 2x$, which is continuous over $U$. However, $f(1,1) = 1$, but $f(1,-1) = 0$. Thus, there exists a continuously differentiable function $f : U \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0$ throughout $U$, and there exists $(x,y_1),(x,y_2) \in U$ with $f(x,y_1) \neq f(x,y_2)$.
  \end{sol}
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{3}
Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be Lipschitz, and let $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a measurable set with $m(E) = 0$. Prove that $m(f(E)) = 0$. (Hint: write open intervals in the form $(a - r, a + r)$ rather than in the form $(a,b)$.) (Recall that $f$ is \textit{Lipschitz} if there is a constant $C > 0$ such that for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$, $\left| f(x) - f(y) \right| \leq C \left| x - y \right|$.)
\end{problem}

\begin{sol}
  Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be Lipschitz, and let $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a measurable set with $m(E) = 0$.
\end{sol}

\begin{problem}{4}
Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a nonnegative measurable function. Suppose that $\int f = 0$. Prove that $f = 0$ almost everywhere. (Hints: let $E_n = \{f \geq \frac{1}{n}\}$ and let $p_n = \frac{1}{n} \chi_{E_n}$.)
\end{problem}

\begin{sol}
  Suppose for some $X \subseteq \text{dom}(f)$ that is measurable, $\int_X f = 0$. Let $E_n = \{x \in X : f(x) > \frac{1}{n}\}$. Then, $\{x \in X : f(x) > 0\} = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}E_n$. Then, 
          \begin{align*}
            m(E_n) &= \int_{E_n}1 \cdot \chi_{E_n} \\
            &= n \int_{E_n} \frac{1}{n} \cdot \chi_{E_n} \\
            &\leq n \int_{E_n} f \\
            &\leq n \int_{X} f \\
            &=0.
          \end{align*}
          Therefore, $m(E_n) = 0$, which implies $f = 0$ a.e., since $X$ was an arbitrary measurable set in the domain of $f$.
\end{sol}

\begin{problem}{5}
For $n = 1,2,3,\dots$ let $f_n : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a nonnegative measurable function. Suppose that the sequence $(f_n)$ is decreasing, in the sense that for each $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $f_1(x) \geq f_2(x) \geq f_3(x) \geq \dots$. Suppose further that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n = 0$. Prove that $(f_n) \to 0$ almost everywhere.
